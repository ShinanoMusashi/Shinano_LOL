## ðŸ§° Local WAD Extractor (Mac/Web)

Included in this repo is a fully working **WAD WebUI Tool** that lets you:
- Upload `.wad.client` files from League's game client
- View, extract, and inspect embedded `.bin`, `.dds`, `.skl`, and other assets
- Use it locally in a browser with a dark-themed UI

### ðŸš€ How to Use the Extractor

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `pip install flask xxhash`

#### Run the WebUI

```bash
cd wad-webui
python app.py
```

Then open: http://localhost:5000
Drag in any .wad.client file and the tool will extract its contents.

## ðŸ§° Local BIN Decoder (Python CLI)

Included in this repo is **`ritobin_mac.py`** â€“ a standalone script that:

- Reads any Riot `.bin` file (character skins, VFX, audio, etc.)
- Resolves every hashed field/type name using Riotâ€™s official hash tables
- Emits a clean `.py` module (`data = {...}`) you can import or inspect

### ðŸš€ How to Use the Decoder

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or newer  
- Install one tiny dependency:  
  ```bash
  pip install xxhash
  
# from the repo root
python bin-webui/ritobin_mac.py path/to/skin*.bin
